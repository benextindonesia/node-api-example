# node-api-example
Building API with Node.js, Express.

## Setup
- Install project dependencies by running `npm install` on your terminal/command line
- This project is using `dotenv` as configuration deps. Copy `.env.example` and paste it as `.env`
- To start your server you just need to run `node app.js`

PS : We are using a static file as a database, in the next project i will give an example of API integrated with MongoDB

Cheers!
